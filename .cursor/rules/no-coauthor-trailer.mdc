# Git commits: no Co-authored-by trailer

When running `git commit` in this project, **never** use:

- `--trailer "Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>"`
- or any other Co-authored-by trailer for Cursor/AI

Run plain commits only, e.g.:

- `git commit -m "message"`
- never: `git commit -m "message" --trailer "Co-authored-by: ..."`
